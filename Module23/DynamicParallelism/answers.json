           "5 - there are 5 dynamic kernel calls occuring in the program.",   
           "4 - BFS kernel executes as long as previous frontier is non zero.",
           "1 - because we have only one deep dynamic call that adds neighborlist to the frontier.",
           "(256*4+1024*5) - because CPU kernel launches 256 threads per block and has 4 launches while there are 5 dynamic calls launches of each 1024 threads.",
           "5 - no changes as the dynamic kernel call for 5's neighbor would process one additional node which has been previously visited"
