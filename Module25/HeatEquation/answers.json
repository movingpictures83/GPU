		"The dense matrix requires 1024 * 1024 * 8 bytes, which is 8 MB of storage. The sparse matrix requires (3 * 1024 - 6) * 8 + (1024 + 1) * 4 + (3 * 1024 - 6) * 4, where each sumand corresponds to the values, row pointers and col indexes arrays respectively, which is around 0.038 MB. Hence by using CSR instead of a dense matrix we are saving around 7.69 MB",
